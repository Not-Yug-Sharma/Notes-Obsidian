# C Tokens
C tokens are the smallest units of a C program that hold meaning to the compiler. The different types of C tokens are:
	1. Identifier:
		- Identifiers are the names of variables, constants, functions, arrays etc.
		- They are user defined.
		- There are rules to defining a new Identifier. They are:
			- An identifier should only consist of alphabets(a-z or A-Z), numbers(0-9) and underscore( _ ).
			- An identifier must start with an alphabet(a-z or A-Z).
			- Generally Identifiers are case sensitive, i.e. Ram is not the same as ram.

	2. Keywords:
		- Reserved words that have predefined meaning and function that cannot be changed.
		- Keywords must always be written in lower-case.

		- User-defined values that do not change throughout the code execution are called constant values.
	4. Strings:
		- Sequence of characters, numbers, symbols and space( ).
	5. Operators:
		- Special symbols that perform
