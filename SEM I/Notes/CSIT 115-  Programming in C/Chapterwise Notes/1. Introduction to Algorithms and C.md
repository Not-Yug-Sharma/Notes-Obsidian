C tokens are the smallest units of a C program that hold meaning to the compiler. The different types of C tokens are:<br>
	1. Identifier:<br>
		- Identifiers are the names of variables, constants, functions, arrays etc.<br>
		- They are user defined.<br>
		- There are rules to defining a new Identifier. They are:<br>
			- An identifier should only consist of alphabets(a-z or A-Z), numbers(0-9) and underscore( _ ).<br>
			- An identifier must start with an alphabet(a-z or A-Z).<br>
			- Generally Identifiers are case sensitive, i.e. Ram is not the same as ram.<br>
			- <b>KEYWORDS</b> cannot be used as identifiers.<br>
	2. Keywords:<br>
		- Reserved words that have predefined meaning and function that cannot be changed.<br>
		- Keywords must always be written in lower-case.<br>
		- Example: int, char, string, float etc.<br>
	3. Constants:<br>
		- User-defined values that do not change throughout the code execution are called constant values.<br>
	4. Strings:<br>
		- Sequence of characters, numbers, symbols and space( ).<br>
	5. Operators:<br>
		- Special symbols that perform operations.<br>
		- Example: +, -, * , /, \\, etc.
## Data Types:
