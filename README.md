# If you like seeing organized things avoid other files other than README.md on GitHub's website


# <p align="center">Files will look weird while viewing directly through GitHub.</p> 
This is because though both are markdown files GitHub's .md need to follow rules of GFM or GitHub Flavored Markdown, whereas Obsidian has no strict boundaries for use of Markdown. Best option would be to read only the README.md file on the website and other notes after cloning the repository.<br>
<b><i>Why not format all notes like this README file you ask?</i></b><br>
That is because this simple looking file has a lot of formatting. All line-breaks are added manually using the \<br> tag. Even writing the \<br> tag needed to be formatted accordingly by adding a "\\" in front of it to let it not register as an official HTML tag.<br>

# Do keep this in mind
Any sort of program will not be viewable directly on the Obsidian app. All written and executable codes will be available here in the repo but it needs to be opened separately in your code editor. This will primarily be easy if you use VSCode, but if you use Linux and are on any form of NVim then good luck.
# Not my official Git account.
# Who Am I?
My name is Yug Sharma Timilsina, a CSIT student currently studying in Gandaki Academy Of Interdisciplinary Studies or GAINS for short. To know more about the college use the logo above, it is hyperlinked to the college's official website.


# Notes for What?
These are notes based on the curriculum/syllabus for CSIT of Far-Western University of Nepal.

The syllabus for all courses of a Semester will be included in the respective SEM folders.

# Progression of these notes
The notes will follow the following pattern:<ul>
	<li>Proper Statements:<ul>
		<li>Based on the course to the point and features approved definitions, codes etc.</li> </ul> </li>
	<li>Caveman terms:<ul>
		<li>Extremely simplified version. Just for the sake of understanding the concept and cuz its funny..... </li></ul></li>
</ul>

# Regarding the use of these notes

The notes that are already on this repo or those that will be added will be made primarily by me. The notes here may miss some points here and there as i am making them as I am learning. So the notes can be used as a means to understand the majority of the topics but self prep is equally important.


# What won't be included:
Calculus notes will not be included because it is difficult to digitalize all those symbols and IMO it is better to practice subjects with direct connection to mathematics individually. Still the books, syllabus and question banks will be provided along with those of other subjects.

# Integrating this repo to your Obsidian App:

You need the following before integrating this Repository:
<ol>
	<li> Obsidian : <a href=https://obsidian.md/download>Use this link and download the variant depending on your OS</a> </li> 
	<li>GIT: <a href="https://git-scm.com/install/">Use this link and download the variant depending on your OS</a><br>Or you can use the following command on windows CMD : winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget <br> This for Linux <i>If You Use Sudo</i> : sudo pacman -S git </li>
	<li> Clone this repo to the desired destination in your computer by using this command in your command prompt: git clone https://github.com/Not-Yug-Sharma/Notes-Obsidian.git</li><ul> <li> Or you can just copy and paste the following after adding your user folder name in place of (Your User Folder):<br> cd "C:\Users\(Your User folder)\Documents\Obsidian Vault"<br> git clone https://github.com/Not-Yug-Sharma/Notes-Obsidian.git</li> </ul> </li><li>Finally Open Obsidian, if you have cloned the repo in the default Obsidian folder, the notes will show up naturally. Else look for s pop up menu that says Obsidian Vault ---> Manage Vaults ---> Open folder as vault, then select the folder you cloned the repo in as your vault.</li> </ol>

# Automating the updates:

If you want constant updates you can do the following:
<ol><li>Manual method: <br> On command prompt cd to the directory(location) where you previously cloned the repo. Then just enter "git pull". If there are changes this will automatically apply them to your "Downloaded" repo as well. While using <u>git pull</u> only the changes will be downloaded.</li> <li> Automatic "git pull on startup": <br><ul><li> Open notepad and paste the following : <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>@echo off<br>cd /d "C:\Path\To\Your\Repo" <br>git pull<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>#if you downloaded at the default Obsidian Vault<br>@echo off<br>cd /d "C:\Users\(Your User folder)\Documents\Obsidian Vault" <br>git pull<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> And save it as a .bat file (Use note_update.bat for future ease.)</li> <li>Open Run(Win+R) and go to shell:startup</li> <li> Paste a shortcut to the .bat there.</li> </ul> </li></ol>


# <p align="center">Happy Learning!</p>

# Do you <i>have</i> to do this?
Yes and no. Yes because after starting off in the field of <b>IT</b> it is absolutely necessary to be aware about and know how to use git. So better start now rather than to worry about it later.<br><hr><br> No because you are not required to learn from my notes. I am also doing this to be familiar to git and be able to use it naturally.
# Final remarks: 

If you have any problems while setting things up you can contact me at anytime during college hours or message me through Insta or Messenger <i> though I don't quite respond to unknown dms</i>:
